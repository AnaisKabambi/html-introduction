  <h2>You can always count on me when...</h2>
    <p>Whenever questions are asked, I will do my best to provide an answer.<br>
      I am good at problem-solving. I sometimes even delve into the second page of Google.</p>


  <h2>A funny story</h2>
    <p>I was babysitting for 2 kids, a boy and a girl. The boy had difficulty falling asleep so I stayed with
    him until he slept in. I had told the girl, who's older, to go to sleep and be good since I already told her a story and all that good stuff.<br>
    When the boy was finally asleep I went to check on the girl. When I turned on the lights, she was in the middle of the room, no pyjama's on, covered in lotion!<br>
    This wasn't normal lotion, it was a thick, anti-allergic cream. So I had to bathe a child in the middle of the night.</p>
    <h3>TL;DR</h3>

      <p style="border: dimgray; border-style: dotted"><br>Went babysitting for 2 kids. Girl wasn't tired so decided to lotion herself up.<br>
      Made a huge mess that I had to clean up in the middle of the night.</p>
